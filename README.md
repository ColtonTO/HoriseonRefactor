#HoriseonRefactor

##Hello, thanks for checking out the README! below you will find details of this project.

-My motivation for this project was simply to refactor the website from Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

-I built this project because this website needed to be refactored as it did not follow accessibility standards.
-Not only that, the user also wanted their site to be optimized for search engines, which was also followed-up on in my work by refactoring the code. 

-The user wanted the website to be refactored for accessibility standardization and search engine optimization, this refactor solved both issues. 

-In this project, I learned how valuable it is to refactor a website with poorly designed code, as it can help make the code look much neater and more organized. 

-What makes this project standout is how organized it is. Through the use of semantic elements in HTML, it is super easy to debug and pull apart the code! Super organized!
